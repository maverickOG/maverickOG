### Hi there!

I’m Sajit, a full-stack developer and designer based in Bangalore.

I’m currently a founding member and developer at [Masusu](https://masusu.vercel.app/), an agency I co-founded with [Manaswini](https://github.com/ManaswiniN234). Masusu is a web development agency that also dives into automation, design, and social media management. Alongside this, I am sharpening my skills in computer science while working on real-world projects.

I enjoy building dynamic web apps with React, Tailwind, and Node, and solving problems with Python and C++. My work blends design thinking with engineering, aiming to craft digital experiences that are as functional as they are meaningful.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about basketball, gaming, automobiles, motorcycles, and books — a mix that keeps me curious, creative, and grounded.
